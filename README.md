# CV repository

This repository contains my CV (in English) and motivation letters (in Dutch).  
GitHub Actions automatically build downloadable PDFs as [Releases](./releases), so I can share a stable link to my CV or letters without sending endless versions back and forth.

This is not meant to be a public repository but if you do stumble on it... have fun reading. Lol. üòÑ

### Why this repo exists

* I prefer **open source tools** over closed ecosystems (e.g. Microsoft Office).
* **Single source of truth:** my CV is always available at the same permanent URL.
* A chance to **flex my DevOps / GitHub skills** to potential employers.

### Personal note

I daily-drive **Linux Mint** and love it.  
I believe in taking back control: own your tools, understand your systems, and build things yourself. It‚Äôs the harder path, but absolutely worth it.

Much respect to the countless individuals who contribute to open-source projects (like LibreOffice) that make all of this possible. You‚Äôre often taken for granted, but your work empowers millions. I see you ‚Äî and I‚Äôm grateful. ‚ù§Ô∏è

### For employers

If you‚Äôre here because you received a link to my CV: welcome!  
Please also check out my other repositories to see my coding style, values, and interests.  

If you‚Äôre looking for someone who can help you **build meaningful software**, I‚Äôd be glad to talk.
